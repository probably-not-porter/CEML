# Snippets - Composite Edge Detection in Convolutional Neural Networks
## Porter Libby - Senior Capstone Project Spring 2020

## Future Plans
- `file_system.py` is an early piece of a plan to give the project file responsiveness. This would confirm with the user the amount of space available where they are working and the approximate amount of space that the project will use while running.
- `GUI.py` is an early GUI, written for this project. It is rough and unpolished, but it represents the basic structure that a GUI would need to be as user-friendly as possible.

## Other Snippets
- `edge_detectors.py` and `edge_testing.py` are both files that were used during development to tune the processes later used in `Official_Code`.

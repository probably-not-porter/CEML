## Project Layout

Note: The layout of these READMEs and notes use a fair bit of markdown, so if you aren't looking at it with markdown support, it may be harder to use.

To keep all of my resources organized over the course of this project, I have devided up my work into a couple of different folders and formats. I will go over these here, and then describe each in more detail in a README present in each subfolder.

- **Notebooks** - The notebooks folder contains most of my jupyter work with this project. All of my demos are jupyter notebooks, as well as all the tests I collected data from for my paper and poster. All of these notebooks can be found in this folder, along with a few other testing notebooks I have used along the way. </br></br>*Note*: Some of these files have been moved here after they were run in an attempt to organize things in a sensible manner. If you need to run or use them, consider moving the notebook you need into a folder with the source code from the `Official_Code` folder. 

- **Official_Code** - This folder contains the most current version of the project. This is the code you are likely to need if you want to use this project for new data.

- **Snippets** - This folder contains a few more bits and pieces that I experimented with over the course of this project. I have included them here as a suppliment to the "future work" section of my paper, as I think some of them reflect things I would like to see in the software eventually.

## Project Environment and Dependencies
When setting up to run the code in these folders, there are a few things to keep in mind. From my personal expirience, fastai and torch a tricky to get working, so I will provide the as many details about my environment as I can.

Python version 3.7.5 64bit<br>
Ubuntu 19.10<br><br>
**Dependencies**:
- tkinter
- matplotlib
- getopt
- opencv-python
- fastai
- pytorch
- Pillow
- numpy
- scipy
